<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-141554"></A>An SDS has an index and a reference number associated with it. The <EM CLASS="Definition">

reference number</EM>
 is a unique positive integer assigned to the data set by the SD interface when the data set is created. Various SD interface routines can be used to obtain an SDS index or reference number depending on the available information about the SDS. The index can also be determined if the sequence in which the data sets are created in the file is known.</P>

The identifier is then used by other SD interface routines to access the SDS until the access to this SDS is terminated. For an existing data set, the index of the data set can be used to obtain the identifier.

Important Note:</EM>
<A NAME="50593873_Same name"></A></P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-301275"></A>HDF4 allows a dimension and a one-dimensional SDS to be given the same name.  The library also stores a dimension and a data set the same way internally. Prior to HDF 4.2.2, however, the library did not adequately distinguish these two types of objects.  Thus, when a dimension and a one-dimensional SDS shared a name, writing to the SDS or the dimension could cause data corruption to the other. The corrupted data was unrecoverable.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-301264"></A>This problem was fixed in Release 4.2.2 and such data corruption will not occur in files created with a 4.2.2 or later library. Note, however, that the fix is effective only in new files; a dimension and a one-dimensional SDS of the same name that were created with a pre-4.2.2 HDF4 Library remain vulnerable to data corruption if an application is unaware of the potential conflict. To safely handle pre-4.2.2 files, the library now provides two functions, <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDgetnumvars_byname</EM>
 and <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDnametoindices</EM>
. <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDgetnumvars_byname</EM>
 can be used to determine whether a name is unique. If the function reports one ('1') variable by that name, the name is unique and no further precaution needs to be taken. If the name is not unique, i.e., the number of variables by that name is greater than one, <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDnametoindices</EM>
 must then be used to retrieve the index and the type of each variable with that name. The desired variable can then be safely selected via its index. These functions are described in detail in this User's Guide and the HDF4 Reference Manual.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-301295"></A>A similar problem is possible when a multi-dimensional SDS and a dimension are created with the same name by a pre-4.2.2 library. The HDF Group has not seen such a failure, however, and it is thought to be very unlikely. Note that the fix introduced in Release 4.2.2 also prevents data corruption from happening for this situation even though the data was created with libraries prior to 4.2.2, assuming no corruption had yet occurred.</P>

hyperslab</EM>
 (or <EM CLASS="Definition">
slab</EM>
, as it will be used in this chapter) is in order. <A NAME="50593873_marker-46573"></A>A <EM CLASS="Definition">
slab</EM>
 is a group of SDS array elements that are stored in consecutive locations. It can be of any size and dimensionality as long as it is a subset of the array, which means that a single array element and the entire array can both be considered slabs. A slab is defined by the multidimensional coordinate of its initial vertex and the lengths of each dimension. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-46537"></A>Given this description of the slab concept, the usage of the remaining arguments should become apparent. The argument <EM CLASS="VarName">
start</EM>
 is a one-dimensional array specifying the location in the SDS array at which the write operation will begin. The values of each element of the array <EM CLASS="VarName">
start</EM>
 are relative to 0 in both the C and FORTRAN-77 interfaces. The size of <EM CLASS="VarName">
start</EM>
 must be the same as the number of dimensions in the SDS array. In addition, each value in <EM CLASS="VarName">
start</EM>
 must be smaller than its corresponding SDS array dimension unless the dimension is unlimited. Violating any of these conditions causes <EM CLASS="FunctionName">

<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-156833"></A>The<A NAME="50593873_marker-227108"></A> argument <EM CLASS="VarName">
stride</EM>
 is a one-dimensional array specifying, for each dimension, the interval between values to be written. For example, setting the first element of the array <EM CLASS="VarName">
stride</EM>
 equal to 1 writes data to every location along the first dimension. Setting the first element of the array <EM CLASS="VarName">
stride</EM>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-160544"></A><A NAME="50593873_marker-160543"></A>An SDS array can be made appendable, however, only along one dimension. This dimension must be specified as an <EM CLASS="Definition">
appendable dimension</EM>
 when it is created.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-160545"></A>In C, only the first element of the <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDcreate </EM>
parameter <EM CLASS="VarName">
dim_sizes</EM>
 (i.e., the dimension of the lowest rank or the slowest-changing dimension) can be assigned the value <EM CLASS="DefName">
SD_UNLIMITED</EM>
 (or <EM CLASS="DefName">
0</EM>
) to make the first dimension unlimited. In FORTRAN-77, only the <EM CLASS="VarName">
last </EM>
dimension (i.e., the dimension of the highest rank or the slowest-changing dimension) can be unlimited. In other words, in FORTRAN-77 <EM CLASS="VarName">
dim_sizes(rank)</EM>
 must be set to the value <EM CLASS="DefName">
SD_UNLIMITED</EM>
 to make the last dimension appendable. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-17053"></A>To append data to a data set without overwriting previously-written data, the user must specify the appropriate coordinates in the <EM CLASS="VarName">
start</EM>
 parameter of the <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDwritedata</EM>
 routine. For example, if 15 data elements have been written to an unlimited dimension, appending data to the array requires a <EM CLASS="VarName">
start</EM>
 coordinate of 15. Specifying a starting coordinate less than the current number of elements written to the unlimited dimension will result in data being overwritten. In either case, all of the coordinates in the array except the one corresponding to the unlimited dimension must be equal to or less than the lengths of their corresponding dimensions.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-144686"></A>Any time an unlimited dimension is appended to, the HDF library will automatically adjust the dimension record to the new length. If the newly-appended data begins beyond the previous length of the dimension, the locations between the old data and the beginning of the newly-appended data are initialized to the assigned fill value if there is one defined by the user, or the default fill value if none is defined. Refer to <A HREF="UG_html-3.htm#50593873_14160" CLASS="XRef">Fill Values and Fill Mode</A> for a discussion of fill value.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-158035"></A>The <A NAME="50593873_marker-158034"></A>HDF library provides routines to store SDS arrays in an <EM CLASS="Definition">
external file</EM>
<A NAME="50593873_marker-162919"></A> that is separate from the <EM CLASS="Definition">
primary file</EM>
 containing the metadata for the array. Such an SDS array is called an <EM CLASS="Definition">
external SDS array</EM>
<A NAME="50593873_marker-162926"></A>. With external arrays, it is possible to link data sets in the same HDF file to multiple external files or data sets in different HDF files to the same external file. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-140922"></A>External arrays are functionally identical to arrays in the primary data file. The HDF library keeps track of the beginning of the data set and adds data at the appropriate position in the external file. When data is written or appended along a specified dimension, the HDF library writes along that dimension in the external file and updates the appropriate dimension record in the primary file.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-17188"></A><A NAME="50593873_marker-26886"></A>There are two methods for creating external SDS arrays. The user can create a new data set in an external file or move data from an existing internal data set to an external file. In either case, only the array values are stored externally, all metadata remains in the primary HDF file. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-46792"></A>When an external array is created, a sufficient amount of space is reserved in the external file for the entire data set. The data set will begin at the specified byte offset and extend the length of the data set. The write operation will overwrite the target locations in the external file. The external file may be of any format, provided the data types, byte ordering, and dimension ordering are supported by HDF. However, the primary file must be an HDF file.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-46787"></A>Routines for manipulating external SDS arrays can only be used with HDF files. Unidata-formatted netCDF files are not supported by these routines.</P>

Data of an existing data set in the primary file can only be moved to the external file once. During the operation, the data is written to the external file as a contiguous stream regardless of how it is stored in the primary file. Because data is moved as is, any unwritten locations in the data set are preserved in the external file. Subsequent read and write operations performed on the data set will access the external file.</P>

This number includes the starting bit and the count proceeds toward the right end of the bit field - toward the lower-bit numbers. For example, starting at bit 5 and writing 4 bits of the bit field described in the preceding paragraph would result in the bit field <EM CLASS="DefName">

 specifies whether to use the left-most bit of the variable-length bit field to sign-extend to the left-most bit of the data set data. For example, if 9-bit signed integer data is extracted from bits 17-25 and the bit in position 25 is <EM CLASS="DefName">
1</EM>

This section describes SD interface routines which store and retrieve information on dimensions and dimension scales. When a dimension scale is set for a dimension, the library stores the dimension and its associated information as an SDS array.

<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-25447"></A><A NAME="50593873_marker-27045"></A>A <EM CLASS="Definition">
dimension scale</EM>
 can be thought of as a series of numbers demarcating intervals along a dimension. One scale is assigned per dimension. Users of netCDF can think of them as analogous to <EM CLASS="Definition">
coordinate variables</EM>
. In the SDS data model, each dimension scale is a one-dimensional array with name and size equal to its assigned dimension name and size.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-163245"></A>For example, if a dimension of length 6 named &quot;depth&quot; is assigned a dimension scale, its scale is a one-dimensional array of length 6 and is also assigned the name &quot;depth&quot;. The name of the dimension will also appear as the name of the dimension scale.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-25450"></A>Recall that when dimension scale is assigned to a dimension, the dimension is implemented as an SDS array with data being the data scale. Although dimension scales are conceptually different from SDS arrays, they are implemented as SDS arrays by the SDS interface and are treated similarly by the routines in the interface. For example, when the <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDfileinfo</EM>
 routine returns the number of data sets in a file, it includes dimension scales in that number. The <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDiscoordvar</EM>
 routine (described in <A HREF="UG_html-3.htm#50593873_25183" CLASS="XRef">Distinguishing SDS Arrays from Dimension Scales: SDiscoordvar</A>) distinguishes SDS data sets from dimension scales.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-142644"></A><A NAME="50593873_marker-142643"></A>SD data sets with one or more dimensions with the same name and size are considered to be related. Examples of related data sets are cross-sections from the same simulation, frames in an animation, or images collected from the same apparatus. HDF attempts to preserve this relationship by unifying their dimension scales and attributes. To understand how related data sets are handled, it is necessary to understand what dimension records are and how they are created.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-13421"></A><A NAME="50593873_marker-27066"></A>In the SD interface, dimension records are only created for dimensions of a unique name and size. To illustrate this, consider a case where there are three scientific data sets, each representing a unique variable, in an HDF file. <A HREF="UG_html-3.htm#50593873_31617" CLASS="XRef">(See Figure 3c)</A> The first two data sets have two dimensions each and the third data set has three dimensions. There are a total of four dimensions in the file and the name mapping between the data sets and the dimensions are shown in the figure. Note that if, for example, the creation of a second dimension named &quot;Altitude&quot; is attempted and the size of the dimension is different from the existing dimension named &quot;Altitude&quot;, an error condition will be generated.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-14436"></A>As expected, assigning a dimension attribute to dimension 1 of either data set will create the required dimension scale and assign the appropriate attribute. However, because related data sets share dimension records, they also share dimension attributes. Therefore, it is impossible to assign an attribute to a dimension without assigning the same attribute to all dimensions of identical name and size, either within one data set or related data sets.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">

<A NAME="50593873_marker-27074"></A>is maintained that identifies the number of values in the attribute. Each attribute has a unique <EM CLASS="Definition">

<A NAME="50593873_marker-27075"></A>, the value of which ranges from 0 to the total number of attributes minus 1. The attribute index is used to locate an attribute in the object which the attribute is attached to. Once the attribute is identified, its values and information can be retrieved.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6843"></A><A NAME="50593873_marker-27078"></A>The data types permitted for attributes are the same as those allowed for SDS arrays. SDS arrays with general attributes of the same name can have different data types. For example, the attribute <EM CLASS="VarName">
valid_range</EM>
 specifying the valid range of data values for an array of 16-bit integers might be of type 16-bit integer, whereas the attribute <EM CLASS="VarName">
valid_range</EM>
 for an array of 32-bit floats could be of type 32-bit floating-point integer. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6844"></A><A NAME="50593873_marker-27079"></A>Attribute names follow the same rules as dimension names. Providing meaningful names for attributes is important, however using standardized names may be necessary if generic applications and utility programs are to be used. For example, every variable assigned a unit should have an attribute named &quot;<EM CLASS="VarName">
units</EM>
&quot; associated with it. Furthermore, if an HDF file is to be used with software that recognizes &quot;units&quot; attributes, the values of the &quot;units&quot; attributes should be expressed in a conventional form as a character string that can be interpreted by that software.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-13432"></A>The SD interface uses the same functions to access all attributes regardless of the objects they are assigned to. The difference between accessing a file, array, or dimension attribute lies in the use of identifiers. File identifiers, SDS identifiers, and dimension identifiers are used to respectively access file attributes, SDS attributes, and dimension attributes. </P>

<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6854"></A><EM CLASS="Definition">
Labels</EM>
<A NAME="50593873_marker-27094"></A> can be thought of as variable names. They are often used as keys in searches to find a particular predefined attribute.</LI>

Units</EM>
<A NAME="50593873_marker-312037"></A> are a means of declaring the units pertinent to a specific discipline. A freely-available library of routines is available to convert between character string and binary forms of unit specifications and to perform useful operations on the binary forms. This library is used in some netCDF applications and is recommended for use with HDF applications. For more information, refer to the <EM CLASS="TextItalic">
netCDF User’s Guide for C</EM>

Formats</EM>
<A NAME="50593873_marker-312039"></A> describe the format in which numeric values will be printed and/or displayed. The recommended convention is to use standard FORTRAN-77 notation for describing the data format. For example, &quot;F7.2&quot; means to display seven digits with two digits to the right of the decimal point.</LI>

<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6857"></A><EM CLASS="Definition">
Coordinate systems</EM>
<A NAME="50593873_marker-27097"></A> contain information that should be used when interpreting or displaying the data. For example, the text strings &quot;cartesian&quot;, &quot;polar&quot; and &quot;spherical&quot; are recommended coordinate system descriptions.</LI>

Ranges</EM>
<A NAME="50593873_marker-27098"></A> define the maximum and minimum values of a selected valid range. The range may cover the entire data set, values outside the data set, or a subset of values within a data set. Because the HDF library does not check or update the range attribute as data is added or removed from the file, the calling program may assign any values deemed appropriate as long as they are of the same data type as the SDS array.</LI>

<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6851"></A>Predefined attributes are useful because they establish conventions that applications can depend on and because they are understood by the HDF library without users having to define them.

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6891"></A>The SD interface provides two methods for accessing predefined attributes. The first method uses the general attribute routines for user-defined attributes described in <A HREF="UG_html-3.htm#50593873_14370" CLASS="XRef">User-defined Attributes</A>; the second employs routines specifically designed for each attribute and will be discussed in the following sections. Although the general attribute routines work well and are recommended in most cases, the specialized attribute routines are sometimes easier to use, especially when reading or writing related predefined attributes. This is true for two reasons. First, because predefined attributes are guaranteed unique names, the attribute index is unnecessary. Second, attributes with several components may be read as a group. For example, using the SD routine designed to read the predefined calibration attribute returns all five components with a single call, rather than five separate calls.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-13802"></A>There is one exception: unlike predefined data set attributes, predefined dimension attributes should be read or written using the specialized attribute routines only.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-29529"></A>The predefined attribute parameters are described in <A HREF="UG_html-3.htm#50593873_18186" CLASS="XRef">Table 3V</A>. Creating a predefined attribute with parameters different from these will produce unpredictable results when the attribute is read using the corresponding predefined-attribute routine.</P>

.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-163998"></A>Writing fill values to an SDS can involve more I/O overhead than is necessary, particularly in situations where the data set is to be contiguously filled with data before any read operation is made. In other words, writing fill values is only necessary when there is a possibility that the data set will be read before all gaps between writes are filled with data, i.e., before all elements in the array have been assigned values. Thus, for a file that has only data sets containing contiguous data, the fill mode should be set to <EM CLASS="DefName">
SD_NOFILL</EM>
 (or <EM CLASS="DefName">
256</EM>
). Avoiding unnecessary filling can substantially increase the application performance.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-164740"></A>For a non-contiguous data set, the array elements that have no actual data values must be filled with a fill value before the data set is read. Thus, for a file that has a non-contiguous data set, the fill mode should be set to <EM CLASS="DefName">
SD_FILL</EM>
 (or <EM CLASS="DefName">
0</EM>
) and a fill value will be written to the all data sets in the file.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-164741"></A>Note that, currently, <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDsetfillmode</EM>
 specifies the fill mode of all data sets in the file. Thus, either all data sets are in<EM CLASS="DefName">
 SD_FILL </EM>
mode or all data sets are in<EM CLASS="DefName">
 SD_NOFILL </EM>
mode. However, when a specific SDS needs to be written with a fill value while others in the file do not, the following procedure can be used: set the fill mode to <EM CLASS="DefName">
SD_FILL</EM>
, write data to the data set requiring fill values, then set the fill mode back to <EM CLASS="DefName">
SD_NOFILL</EM>
.  This procedure will produce one data set with fill values while the remaining data sets have no fill values.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-14054"></A><A NAME="50593873_marker-27148"></A>HDF supports the netCDF data model and interface developed at the Unidata Program Center (UPC). Like HDF, netCDF is an interface to a library of data access programs that store and retrieve data. The file format developed at the UPC to support netCDF uses XDR (eXternal Data Representation), a non-proprietary external data representation developed by Sun Microsystems for describing and encoding data. Full documentation on netCDF and the Unidata netCDF interface is available at <EM CLASS="URL">
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/</EM>
.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-18223"></A>The netCDF data model is interchangeable with the SDS data model in so far as it is possible to use the netCDF calling interface to place an SDS into an HDF file and conversely the SDS interface will read from an XDR-based netCDF file. Because the netCDF interface has not changed and netCDF files stored in XDR format are readable, existing netCDF programs and data are still usable, although programs will need to be relinked to the new library. However, there are important conceptual differences between the HDF and the netCDF data model that must be understood to effectively use HDF in working with netCDF data objects and to understand enhancements to the interface that will be included in the future to make the two APIs much more similar.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-199090"></A>In the HDF model, when a multidimensional SDS is created by <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDcreate</EM>
, HDF data objects are also created that provide information about the individual dimensions — one for each dimension. Each SDS contains within its internal structure the array data as well as pointers to these dimensions. Each dimension is stored in a structure that is in the HDF file but separate from the SDS array.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6891"></A>If more than one SDS have the same dimension sizes, they may share dimensions by pointing to the same dimensions. This can be done in application programs by calling <EM CLASS="FunctionName">
SDsetdimname</EM>
 to assign the same dimension name to all dimensions that are shared by several SDSs. For example, suppose you make the following sequence of calls for every SDS in a file:</P>
<P CLASS="FM1-syntax">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-29788"></A>	dim_id = SDgetdimid(sds_id, 0);</P>
<P CLASS="syntax">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6946"></A>	ret = SDsetdimname(dim_id, &quot;Lat&quot;);</P>
<P CLASS="syntax">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6803"></A>	dim_id = SDgetdimid(sds_id, 1);</P>
<P CLASS="syntax">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6804"></A>	ret = SDsetdimname(dim_id, &quot;Long&quot;);</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6806"></A>This will create a shared dimension named &quot;<EM CLASS="VarName">
Lat</EM>
&quot; that is associated with every SDS as the first dimension and a dimension named &quot;<EM CLASS="VarName">
Long</EM>
&quot; as the second dimension.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6810"></A>This same result is obtained differently in netCDF. Note that a netCDF &quot;variable&quot; is roughly the same as an HDF SDS. The netCDF interface requires application programs to define all dimensions, using <EM CLASS="VarName">
ncdimdef</EM>
, before defining variables. Those defined dimensions are then used to define variables in <EM CLASS="VarName">
ncvardef</EM>
. Each dimension is defined by a name and a size. All variables using the same dimension will have the same dimension name and dimension size.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-6780"></A>Although the HDF SDS interface will read from and write to existing XDR-based netCDF files, HDF cannot be used to create XDR-based netCDF files.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-14060"></A>There is currently no support for mixing HDF data objects that are not SDSs and netCDF data objects. For example, a raster image can exist in the same HDF file as a netCDF data object, but you must use one of the HDF raster image APIs to read the image and the HDF SD or netCDF interface to read the netCDF data object. The other HDF APIs are currently being modified to allow multifile access. Closer integration with the netCDF interface will probably be delayed until the end of that project.</P>

<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-14066"></A>Existing netCDF applications can be used to read HDF files and existing HDF applications can be used to read XDR-based netCDF files. To read an HDF file using a netCDF application, the application must be recompiled using the HDF library. For example, recompiling the netCDF utility <EM CLASS="VarName">
ncdump</EM>
 with HDF creates a utility that can dump scientific data sets from both HDF and XDR-based files. To read an XDR-based file using an HDF application, the application must be relinked to the HDF library.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-14076"></A>The first three models can create, read, and write SDSs in HDF files. Both the SD and NC interfaces can read from and write to XDR-based netCDF files, but they cannot create them. This interoperability means that a single program may contain both SD and NC function calls and thus transparently read and write scientific data sets to HDF or XDR-based files. </P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593873_pgfId-29672"></A>The SD interface is the only HDF interface capable of accessing the XDR-based netCDF file format. The DFSD interface cannot access XDR-based files and can only access SDS arrays, dimension scales, and predefined attributes.
