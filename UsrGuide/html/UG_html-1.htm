<A NAME="50593871_pgfId-1533554"></A>HDF can be viewed as several interactive levels. At its lowest level, HDF is a physical file format for storing scientific data. At its highest level, HDF is a collection of utilities and applications for manipulating, viewing, and analyzing data stored in HDF files. Between these levels, HDF is a software library that provides high-level and low-level programming interfaces. It also includes supporting software that make it easy to store, retrieve, visualize, analyze, and manage data in HDF files.

, is reserved for software developers. It was designed for direct file I/O of data streams, error handling, memory management, and physical storage.

</H5>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593871_pgfId-4987"></A>Scientists commonly generate and process data files on several different machines, use various software packages to process files and share data files with others who use different machines and software. Also, they may include different kinds of information within one particular file, or within a group of files, and the mixture of these different kinds of information may vary from one file to another. Files may be conceptually related but physically separated. For example, some data may be dispersed among different files and some in program code. It is also possible that data may be related only in the scientist’s conception of the data; no physical relationship may exist.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593871_pgfId-4989"></A><A NAME="50593871_marker-5505"></A>HDF addresses these problems by providing a general-purpose file structure that:</P>
<UL>
<LI CLASS="Bullet">
<A NAME="50593871_pgfId-4991"></A>Provides the mechanism for programs to obtain information about the data in a file from within the file, rather than from another source.</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bullet">
<A NAME="50593871_pgfId-4993"></A>Lets the user store mixtures of data from different sources into a single file as well as store the data and its related information in separate files, even when the files are processed by the same application program.</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bullet">
<A NAME="50593871_pgfId-4995"></A>Standardizes the formats and descriptions of many types of commonly-used data sets, such as raster images and multidimensional arrays.</LI>
<LI CLASS="Bullet">

<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593871_pgfId-38774"></A><A NAME="50593871_marker-38773"></A>HDF APIs are divided into two categories: multifile interfaces (new) and single-file interfaces (old). The multifile interfaces are those that provide simultaneous access to several HDF files from within an application, which is an important feature that the single-file interfaces do not support. It is recommended that the user explore the new interfaces and their features since they are an improvement over the old interfaces. The old interfaces remain simply because of the need for backward compatibility.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="50593871_pgfId-38777"></A>The HDF I/O library consists of C and FORTRAN-77 routines for accessing objects and associated information. Although there is some overlap among object types, in most cases an API operates on data of only one type. Therefore, you need only familiarize yourself with the APIs specific to your needs to access data in an HDF file.</P>
