History of the contents in UsrGuide directory (Mar 11, 2014)
---------------------------------------------

The directory "graphics" contains jpeg files of the images in the User's
Guide.  They were generated when the documents were in FrameMaker 7.1
and WebWork Publisher 8.  After we moved to FrameMaker 11, the images
were generated in GIF files and are put in the html directory.

The directory html_4.2.10_FM11_WWP has the old html files generated
by WWP.
